# DeepSeismic
![DeepSeismic](./assets/DeepSeismicLogo.jpg )

This repository shows you how to perform seismic imaging and interpretation on Azure. It empowers geophysicists and data scientists to run seismic experiments using state-of-art DSL-based PDE solvers and segmentation algorithms on Azure.  

The repository provides sample notebooks, data loaders for seismic data, utility codes, and out-of-the box ML pipelines.


## Interpretation
For seismic interpretation, the repository consists of extensible machine learning pipelines, that shows how you can leverage state-of-art segmentation algorithms (UNet, SEResNET, HRNet) for seismic interpretation, and also benchmarking results from running these algorithms using various seismic datasets (Dutch F3, and Penobscot).

### Setting up Environment
Navigate to the folder where you pulled the DeepSeismic repo to

Run
```bash
conda env create -f environment/anaconda/local/environment.yml
```
This will create the appropriate environment to run experiments

Then you will need to install the common packages for interpretation
```bash
conda activate seismic-interpretation
pip install -e interpretation
```

Then you will also need to install cv_lib
```bash
pip install -e cv_lib
```

Both repos are installed in developer mode with the -e flag. This means that to update simply go to the folder and pull the appropriate commit or branch. 

During development, in case you need to update the environment due to a conda env file change, you can run
```
conda env update --file environment/anaconda/local/environment.yml
```
from the root of DeepSeismic repo.

### Viewers

#### segyviewer

For seismic interpretation (segmentation), if you want to visualize cross-sections of a 3D volume (both the input velocity model and the segmented output) you can use
[segyviewer](https://github.com/equinor/segyviewer), for example like so:
```bash
segyviewer /mnt/dutchf3/data.segy
```

To install [segyviewer](https://github.com/equinor/segyviewer) run
```bash
conda env -n segyviewer python=2.7
conda activate segyviewer
conda install -c anaconda pyqt=4.11.4
pip install segyviewer
```

### Benchmarks

#### Dense Labels

This section contains benchmarks of different algorithms for seismic interpretation on 3D seismic datasets with densely-annotated data.

Below are the results from the models contained in this repo. To run them check the instructions in <benchmarks> folder. Alternatively take a look in <examples> for how to run them on your own dataset

#### Penobscot

Trained and tested on full dataset. Inlines with artefacts were left in for training, validation and testing.
The dataset was split 70% training, 10% validation and 20% test. The results below are from the test set

#### Data
##### Netherlands F3
To download the F3 Netherlands dataset for 2D experiments, please follow the data download instructions at
[this github repository](https://github.com/olivesgatech/facies_classification_benchmark).

To prepare the data for the experiments (e.g. split into train/val/test), please run the following script:

```
# For section-based experiments
python scripts/prepare_dutchf3.py split_train_val section --data-dir=/mnt/dutchf3


# For patch-based experiments
python scripts/prepare_dutchf3.py split_train_val patch --data-dir=/mnt/dutchf3 --stride=50 --patch=100

```

Refer to the script itself for more argument options.

##### Penobscot
To download the Penobscot dataset run the [download_penobscot.sh](scripts/download_penobscot.sh) script, e.g.

```
data_dir='/data/penobscot'
mkdir "$data_dir"
./scripts/download_penobscot.sh "$data_dir"
```

Note that the specified download location (e.g `/data/penobscot`) should be created beforehand, and configured appropriate `write` pemissions.

To prepare the data for the experiments (e.g. split into train/val/test), please run the following script (modifying arguments as desired):

```
python scripts/prepare_penobscot.py split_inline --data-dir=/data/penobscot --val-ratio=.1 --test-ratio=.2
```


#### Scripts
- [parallel_training.sh](scripts/parallel_training.sh): Script to launch multiple jobs in parallel. Used mainly for local hyperparameter tuning. Look at the script for further instructions

- [kill_windows.sh](scripts/kill_windows.sh): Script to kill multiple tmux windows. Used to kill jobs that parallel_training.sh might have started.


## Seismic Imaging
For seismic imaging, the repository shows how you can leverage open-source PDE solvers (e.g. Devito), and perform Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) at scale on Azure, using Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML), and Azure Batch. The repository provides a collection of sample notebooks that shows 

* How you can create customized Docker containers with Devito and use this on Azure
* How you can create Azure ML estimators for performing FWI using Devito. 
This enable the Devito code to easily run on a single machine, as well as multiple machines using Azure ML managed computes.
